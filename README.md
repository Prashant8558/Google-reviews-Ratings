# Google-reviews-Ratings

Hierarchical clustering is a technique used in machine learning and data analysis to group similar items into clusters based on their features. 
To use hierarchical clustering for predicting Google review ratings, you would need a dataset containing information about various businesses, such as their attributes (e.g., location, type of business, operating hours) and their corresponding Google review ratings.

# The process would typically involve:-

# Data Preprocessing:-
Prepare your dataset by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

# Feature Selection/Extraction:-
Decide which features to include in your analysis. Features that could be relevant for predicting review ratings might include the business category, location, average review length, sentiment analysis of reviews, etc.

# Hierarchical Clustering:- 
Apply hierarchical clustering algorithms such as agglomerative clustering to group similar businesses together based on their features.

# Cluster Analysis:-
Analyze the resulting clusters to understand the characteristics of each cluster and how they relate to review ratings. You might find that certain clusters tend to have higher or lower review ratings.


# To implement :-

Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, removing stop words, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization.

Feature Extraction: Extract features from the text data, such as word frequencies, TF-IDF scores, or word embeddings.

Clustering: Apply hierarchical clustering or another clustering algorithm to group similar files together based on their content.

Evaluation: Evaluate the quality of clusters formed and identify the cluster(s) containing the  files that are considered the best based on user feedback or other criteria.
By combining these approaches, you could potentially create a system that recommends with high-quality files based on their content and user reviews.
